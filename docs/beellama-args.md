# BeeLlama v0.4.0 argument reference

This page covers Bee-owned arguments and the upstream arguments whose behavior
BeeLlama extends. Run `llama-server --help` or `llama-cli --help` for the full
upstream surface. See [BeeLlama features](beellama-features.md) for use cases,
limits, and measurement guidance.

## KVarN cache types and SWA overrides

KVarN values are `kvarn2`, `kvarn3`, `kvarn4`, `kvarn5`, `kvarn6`, and
`kvarn8`. K and V may use different bit widths.

CUDA, ROCm/HIP, Vulkan, and CPU consume compressed KVarN records directly in
native FlashAttention paths. Vulkan requires shader Int64 and
buffer-device-address support for its direct route. An explicitly supported
materialization fallback retains compressed persistent storage when a native
route is unavailable. Pre-Turing NVIDIA GPUs use CUDA's portable rotated-domain
body-plus-tail route and require a CUDA 12.4 build or release package. CUDA
13.1 packages target Turing and newer architectures.

| Argument | Env var | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-ctk TYPE`, `--cache-type-k TYPE` | `LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_TYPE_K` | `f16` | Selects the target K cache. Bee adds the six KVarN values and standard `q6_0`, `q6_1`, `q3_0`, `q3_1`, `q2_0`, and `q2_1`. If only K or V is KVarN, the other side is promoted to the same KVarN width with a warning. |
| `-ctv TYPE`, `--cache-type-v TYPE` | `LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_TYPE_V` | `f16` | Selects the target V cache with the same values and one-sided promotion rule as `--cache-type-k`. |
| `--cache-type-k-swa TYPE` | `LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_TYPE_K_SWA` | Same as `--cache-type-k` | Overrides KVarN K precision for SWA layers. Accepts only the six `kvarnN` values, requires target KVarN, and must be paired with the V override. |
| `--cache-type-v-swa TYPE` | `LLAMA_ARG_CACHE_TYPE_V_SWA` | Same as `--cache-type-v` | Overrides KVarN V precision for SWA layers. Accepts only the six `kvarnN` values, requires target KVarN, and must be paired with the K override. |

## KV cache precision tail for quantized caches

The KV cache precision tail (KVCPT) makes the newest attention-visible entries exact in F16 or BF16 for
standard quantized and KVarN target caches. A partial tail keeps the complete
quantized body and adds a compact exact-history ring. The active ubatch remains
a separate graph-local exact source. A full-window SWA request uses a compact
native-exact ring and omits the unread compressed SWA body. Draft and auxiliary
contexts remain on standard cache types and do not inherit the target tail.

| Argument | Env var | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--kv-tail-tokens SPEC` | `LLAMA_ARG_KV_TAIL_TOKENS` | `0` | For standard caches, `0` keeps the ordinary cache path. For KVarN, omitted or `0` retains the intrinsic 128-token exact suffix. A number applies to every canonical group; KVarN rounds positive values upward to complete 128-token groups. `N0,N1` follows canonical group order, while `full=N,swa=N` accepts unique role aliases or structural IDs such as `full@l0`. Invalid, duplicate, incomplete, or wrong-length specifications resolve additional coverage to zero, while KVarN still retains its intrinsic suffix. `auto` requests 1024 exact tokens per applicable target-cache group, capped by that group's effective context or attention window. |
| `--kv-tail-type TYPE` | `LLAMA_ARG_KV_TAIL_TYPE` | `bf16` for standard caches; `f16` for KVarN | Selects `f16` or `bf16` exact storage for compact history and compact-native SWA. An explicit value overrides the cache-family default in either direction. Other types are rejected. |

An omitted tail type remains automatic until context placement. If the standard
BF16 default lacks a complete Metal or SYCL route but F16 is complete, automatic
selection warns and resolves once to F16. Explicit `--kv-tail-type bf16` fails
instead of changing the requested representation.

Explicit values are capped by the group's effective attention window and context
capacity. KVarN values are also rounded upward to 128-token groups. Startup logs
show raw, requested, effective, and window lengths, the structural group ID,
participating layers, selected compact-overlay or compact-native-exact
representation, actual body and exact types, logical history rows, rollback
rows, graph-local body execution rows, owner backend, current-segment
presence, transient estimate, and memory increments. Native routes are checked
again against the final constructed operation. A mismatch fails context/graph
construction instead of allowing the scheduler to move that layer silently.

Let `N` be the resolved exact length, `U` the physical ubatch limit, `R` the
advertised suffix-rollback horizon, and `S` the number of exact streams. Compact
persistent exact capacity is `(N + R) * S` rows and is independent of `U`.
`U` sizes only graph inputs and reusable transient workspace. Backend buffer
alignment may round bytes but does not add logical rows. Exact history remains
per logical sequence even with `--kv-unified`. Positive tails on K-only MLA or
DSA attention are rejected during context creation.

`R` comes from the context's rollback requirement. Contexts that otherwise
request no rollback retain one row for the common one-token capability probe;
it never defaults to `U`. The memory capability API reports this bound, and a
larger speculative removal must use the checkpoint/reprocess path before cache
metadata is mutated.

Partial exact overlays are compatible with `--split-mode layer` and
`--split-mode tensor`. Layer mode keeps each shadow with its ordinary K/V body.
Tensor mode shards standard body/shadow rows, KVarN records and staging, and
exact history at complete KV-head boundaries through the model's meta split
descriptor. Invalid or unsupported component splits fail during cache
construction rather than after graph execution starts.

KVarN's physical staging depth is independent of this logical policy. Increasing
`-ub` may increase transient work but never increases persistent exact coverage.
Completed 128-token records are committed eagerly for partial tails, while the
canonical exact history stores only `N + R` rows. A fully covered SWA group uses
`--kv-tail-type` for its `W + R` compact-native ring and allocates no SWA KVarN
records or stage; non-SWA and partially covered groups remain KVarN.

Partial SWA tails retain the upstream-aligned compressed `W + U` body because
older visible rows still use it. Full-window compact-native SWA has no body and
stores exactly `W + R` persistent rows. In both cases current K/V is consumed
directly by the same attention softmax before an explicitly ordered history
commit.

`llama-bench --kv-memory` reports cache-owned bytes directly. The
`kv_k_payload_bytes`, `kv_v_payload_bytes`, `kv_exact_history_bytes`,
`kv_rollback_reserve_bytes`, `kv_staging_bytes`, `kv_padding_bytes`, and
`kv_resident_bytes` fields describe persistent ownership.
`kv_transient_bytes` is the observed reusable CUDA-pool high water and
`kv_peak_bytes` is resident plus transient. The per-route layer counters show
native bodyless, native mixed, planned device-fallback, and CPU layers. These
fields are more precise than deriving cache memory from whole-process VRAM;
the separate CUDA/WDDM fields remain useful for reconciliation and spill
detection.

Overlay state uses a framed standard-memory section. Exact restore requires the
same structural group, resolved length, representation, and exact type. Native
exact state is carried by the ordinary body and does not serialize a duplicate
shadow. The extended full and sequence state APIs accept
`LLAMA_STATE_SEQ_FLAGS_BODY_ONLY` to deliberately omit overlay shadows; loading
that state into a tail-enabled context is valid, but the coverage API reports
`LLAMA_KV_TAIL_DEGRADED_BODY_ONLY_STATE` until new writes refill the recent
window. Server metrics expose requested/exact token totals, complete/partial/no
coverage group counts, and degraded-sequence counts.

KVarN state version 13 stores logical compressed records and compact exact payloads
independently of ubatch workspace, so state may move between `ub=128` and
`ub=512`. Version 12 remains readable where its logical representation is
compatible; version 11 is rejected rather than reinterpreting its old physical
workspace layout. Tail length, type, preset, rollback horizon, representation,
and structural-group mismatches fail closed.

Sequence state writes precision-tail manifest version 3, including the compact
representation and rollback horizon, and supports host or on-device tensor
transfer. Manifest version 2 remains readable for non-compact layouts; version
1 restores conservative degraded provenance. Immediate body
membership and position changes after sequence copy are preserved; pending
exact rows materialize as one batch when state data is requested.

Restore publishes no tensor or metadata changes until the complete state frame
has validated. A truncated, corrupt, mismatched, or failed backend transfer is
cancelled. Deferred precision-tail copy failures propagate through immediate state
save and subsequent decode instead of being reported as successful.

Prompt-cache message boundaries do not reset the suffix. Standard unified and
non-unified slots reuse continuously. KVarN precision-tail divergence trims
exactly; eligible older divergence reuses from the overlapping 128-token group
boundary on a non-unified or exclusive unified stream. Unified contention, an
unsupported recurrent rollback, `cache_prompt=false`, slot eviction, or no
common target/draft plan produces a safe full reevaluation. Unified KVarN RAM
save and restore require stream exclusivity; contended save is skipped without
clearing the slot, and contended restore is a miss.

## DFlash and adaptive draft depth

The first five rows are upstream speculative controls with Bee-specific DFlash
behavior. The `--spec-dm-*` rows are Bee server additions.

| Argument | Env var | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--spec-type draft-dflash` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_TYPE` | `none` | Enables upstream DFlash. |
| `--spec-draft-model FNAME`, `-md FNAME` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DRAFT_MODEL` | Unused | Loads an upstream-format `dflash` draft GGUF. |
| `--spec-draft-n-max N` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DRAFT_N_MAX` | Upstream: `3`; omitted DFlash: `dflash.block_size - 1` | Sets the maximum draft depth. An explicit CLI or env value always wins; upstream clamps values above the drafter's trained limit. A block-16 drafter therefore defaults to 15 only when this setting is omitted. |
| `--spec-draft-n-min N` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DRAFT_N_MIN` | `0` | Sets the minimum number of draft tokens used by upstream speculation. |
| `--spec-draft-p-min P`, `--draft-p-min P` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DRAFT_P_MIN` | `0.0` | Stops an individual greedy draft when its probability falls below `P`; this is independent of the profit controller. |
| `--spec-dm-controller MODE` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DM_CONTROLLER` | `profit` | `profit` adapts DFlash depth from measured cycle profit; `off` keeps the resolved or explicit maximum static. Other speculative modes are unchanged. |
| `--spec-dm-profit-min F` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DM_PROFIT_MIN` | `0.05` | Sets the minimum margin over the no-spec baseline before clearing disable dwell. Range: `0.0` to `0.50`. |
| `--spec-dm-profit-raise-margin F` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DM_PROFIT_RAISE_MARGIN` | `0.05` | Sets the relative profit margin required to raise draft depth. Range: `0.0` to `1.0`. |
| `--spec-dm-profit-lower-margin F` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DM_PROFIT_LOWER_MARGIN` | `0.05` | Sets the relative profit margin required to lower draft depth. Range: `0.0` to `1.0`. |
| `--spec-dm-profit-ewma-alpha F` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DM_PROFIT_EWMA_ALPHA` | `0.15` | Sets the EWMA weight for profit statistics. Range: `0.01` to `1.0`. |
| `--spec-dm-profit-min-samples N` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DM_PROFIT_MIN_SAMPLES` | `3` | Sets the samples required before a depth's profit statistics are ready. Range: `1` to `64`. |
| `--spec-dm-profit-warmup N` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DM_PROFIT_WARMUP` | `0` | Sets measured samples for each initial positive-depth probe. `0` uses `--spec-dm-profit-min-samples`; range: `0` to `64`. |
| `--spec-dm-profit-baseline-interval N` | `LLAMA_ARG_SPEC_DM_PROFIT_BASELINE_INTERVAL` | `1024` | Sets active controller cycles between no-spec baseline probes. `0` disables periodic probes; range: `0` to `4096`. |

## Reasoning loop guard

| Argument | Env var | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--reasoning-loop-guard MODE` | `LLAMA_ARG_REASONING_LOOP_GUARD` | `force-close` | `off` disables checks, `force-close` asks the reasoning sampler to end hidden reasoning, and `stop` ends generation when a loop triggers. |
| `--reasoning-loop-min-tokens N` | `LLAMA_ARG_REASONING_LOOP_MIN_TOKENS` | `512` | Delays hidden-reasoning checks until `N` reasoning tokens have been seen. Must be non-negative and at least the minimum coverage. |
| `--reasoning-loop-window N` | `LLAMA_ARG_REASONING_LOOP_WINDOW` | `1024` | Sets the token-tail window inspected for repetition. Must be positive and at least the minimum coverage. |
| `--reasoning-loop-max-period N` | `LLAMA_ARG_REASONING_LOOP_MAX_PERIOD` | `128` | Sets the longest periodic loop checked. Must be positive and no more than one third of the window. |
| `--reasoning-loop-min-coverage N` | `LLAMA_ARG_REASONING_LOOP_MIN_COVERAGE` | `256` | Sets the repeated-token coverage required to trigger. Must be positive. |
| `--reasoning-loop-check-interval N` | `LLAMA_ARG_REASONING_LOOP_CHECK_INTERVAL` | `64` | Runs a check after each `N` accepted reasoning tokens. Must be positive. |
| `--reasoning-loop-interventions N` | `LLAMA_ARG_REASONING_LOOP_INTERVENTIONS` | `2` | Sets the maximum successful force-close interventions before a later trigger stops generation. Must be non-negative. |

## Realtime reasoning control

| Argument | Env var | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chat request JSON `"reasoning_control": true` | — | `false` | Arms a live `/v1/chat/completions` request for external reasoning control. The chat template must expose a reasoning end sequence. |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions/control` with `{"id":"chatcmpl-...","action":"reasoning_end"}` | — | Disabled per request | Forces the armed completion's reasoning sampler toward its final-answer phase. Unknown or completed ids return a non-success result; `reasoning_end` is the only accepted action. |

## Parallel constrained decisions

| Argument | Env var | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--decision-seqs N` | `LLAMA_ARG_DECISION_SEQS` | `0` | Reserves `N` sequences for the `/decision` endpoint and enables it. `0` disables the endpoint, otherwise `N` must be at least 3 (one cached prefix, one trunk per context in flight, the rest are branches). Setting it forces the unified KV cache, which is what lets the branches share the prefix cells. `n_parallel + N` must stay at or below 256. |

Details, request and response shape, and the schema grammar are in
[parallel-decision/README.md](../tools/parallel-decision/README.md).

## Presets

| Argument | Env var | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--models-preset PATH` | `LLAMA_ARG_MODELS_PRESET` | Disabled | Loads an INI file containing model presets for router-server mode. Command-line values override values loaded from a preset. |
| Preset key `load-on-startup` | Preset-only | False when absent | A truthy value autoloads that model when router mode starts; the number of startup models may not exceed `--models-max`. |
| Preset key `stop-timeout` | Preset-only | `10` seconds | Force-kills a child model process after this many seconds of graceful shutdown. Invalid values fall back to 10. |

`GET /models` only lists sanitized model identity, status, source, aliases,
tags, and capabilities. It never returns child argv, raw presets, model paths,
or tokens and ignores former reload query parameters. Refresh model sources
with `POST /models/reload`; when `--api-key` is configured this mutation
requires the same `Authorization: Bearer ...` or `X-Api-Key` authentication as
other non-public routes. `--hf-token` is a sensitive option: router children
receive it through `HF_TOKEN`, never through argv or serialized presets.

See [INI presets](preset.md) for syntax, inheritance, remote presets, and a Bee
configuration example.

## KLD measurement

| Argument | Env var | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--save-all-logits FNAME`, `--kl-divergence-base FNAME` | — | Unused | Without `--kl-divergence`, writes the base run's compressed log probabilities to `FNAME`. |
| `--kl-divergence` | — | Off | Compares the current run with the file supplied by `--kl-divergence-base` and returns a nonzero exit code on read or evaluation failure. |

Use the same corpus, context, logical batch, and physical ubatch for both KLD legs.

## CUDA FlashAttention build policy

| Argument | Env var | Default | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-DGGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON` | — | Off | Expands the CUDA vector matrix from 50 to all 169 standard cache pairs and, when `GGML_CUDA_KVARN=ON`, KVarN fast-decode instances from 15 balanced pairs to all 36 ordered bit pairs. Valid KVarN pairs outside the fast matrix use descriptor-native MMA. |
| `-DGGML_CUDA_KVARN=ON/OFF` | — | On | Compiles or omits the shared CUDA/HIP KVarN kernels and CUDA native-attention template instances. When enabled, `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS` selects 15 default or all 36 CUDA fast-decode pairs. CUDA devices without the specialized Turing MMA contract use the portable direct-record route when their warp, thread-block, shared-memory, head-dimension, and tail-type capabilities pass. |

CUDA 12.4 is the release lane for Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta. CUDA 13.1 covers
Turing and newer architectures. The architecture CI compiles SM 5.0, 5.2,
5.3, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 7.0, 7.2, and 7.5 separately with CUDA 12.4, and SM 7.5
through the current Blackwell targets with CUDA 13.1. These are compile gates;
pre-Turing support remains runtime-unqualified until matching real devices pass
the KVarN parity, memory, and model-smoke tests.

## Migration from earlier versions
